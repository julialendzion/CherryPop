            <p>-Dear topic of sex, you are underrated and overrated at the same time.. I didn't know what to think of you when I was younger and I sometimes still struggleing with it now. We should let you be a part of the conversation.

            </p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, I would really like to learn more things about you and how other people think about you.
            </p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, we have done some real shit ,but i think it’s time that we sit down and talk about what really matters and how can we fix some of these things
            </p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, please be more available for everyone: kids, teens, adults and grannys. We need to understand why are you making us feel weird and insecure.
            </p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, can’t wait to meet you!
</p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex I love u
</p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, please be patient with us ♡
</p>
            <p>-It's such a damn difficult topic dude
</p>
<p>-Dear topic of sex, thank you for all the conversations I have had with my friends and boyfriend about you. You aren’t taboo for me and I love talking about you. You’re interesting and I’m thankful that i have people in my life who are not afraid to talk about you.</p>
            <p>-I like you but I’m scared of you :/
</p><p>-Topic of sex, i know you’re dreaded and kids in sixth grade laugh at you. People really don’t  take you seriously for how important you really are. Don’t let that get to you though. In their hearts they do listen and respect you. Keep it going bud

            <p>-Dear topic of sex, i am really affraid of you. I am not afraid to talk about you but a bit uncomfortable. I am scared to have the sexual intercourse with someone, because noone has ever told me how it should be done, like the selfcare etc. You give me soooo many questions.
            </p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex. I really hope that one day when I have children I will be bold enough to go and talk to my children about you and my children will do the same. Also, you are pretty great!
            </p>
            <p>-I can't, I'm sorry :(
            </p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, Thank you for existing and thank you for relieveing our stress level in times we need (no matter if it's sex or masturbation). And making our nights joyful and relationships stronger when talking about it. Lots of love ♡
            </p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, i’m curious to learn more about you but you also scare me a little bit.
</p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, I know nothing about you and because of that I'm afraid I'm gonna be lonely forever.
</p> 
            <p>-Dear topic of sex, 
Why does everyone make such a big deal about you? You scare so many people, you put pressure on them but at the same time you make so many people happy. Why can’t you just make everyone happy? 
You’re someone no one will ever forget in their life, wether it’s positive or negative. 
I am wondering if we will ever become friends or if I will always have a weird gut-feeling when it comes to you in relationships. 
Greetings from Vienna.

            <p>-Dear topic of sex, please learn how to stand up for yourself!
</p>
            <p>-Dear topic of sex. I’m still learning to swap the internalised fear and resentment I feel towards you for curiosity and acceptance. We’ll get there. Xo.
